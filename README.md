# Telecom-Churn_Analysis

To analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn. Performed univariate, bivariate and multi-variate analysis and EDA on the dataset and built various models using ML techniques like logistic regression, Random forest, Decision trees, etc. Feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques in machine learning like RFE and PCA were also implemented.
